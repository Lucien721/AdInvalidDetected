<h1>Getting the Code and Playing with it!</h1>
<h2>Environment..</h2>
<p>We suggest to use the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse
IDE</a> as development platform (e.g., <a
	href="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/">Eclipse IDE for Java
Developers</a>). You may use another package with Java development
functionality.</p>

<h2>Getting the Code..</h2>
<p>We provide a stable version of the library as an Eclipse project
(ZIP file), which includes the source files. In addition we provide a
JAR file, which you can more easily use within your Java application.
You can download the files from the <a
	href="http://prime.inf.tu-dresden.de/idemix/">PrimeLife</a> server. The
simplest way to start exploring the <i>Identity Mixer</i> library is to
use the ZIP file and import it into Eclipse as an ''existing project''
into you Eclipse workspace.</p>

<h2>Running the Test Cases..</h2>
<p>First you have to change a URI such that it points to the
required files residing on your file system. To do this you will have to
change the parameter <u>BASE_LOCATION</u> that resides in <u>com.ibm.zrl.idmx.tests.idmx.TestIssuance</u>.
You will have make it point to the location where the parameters (e.g.,
system and group parameters) are located. On Windows this will have to
be something like <i>file:///C:/Users/.../workspace/com.ibm.zrl.idmx.2_3_2/tests/com/ibm/zrl/idmx/tests/files/parameter/</i>
on a UNIX based system the URI will rather be <i>file:///home/username/../parameter/</i>.
Note that you will not have to change the <u>BASE_ID</u> as this must
comply with the URI used in the example files.</p>
<p>Now you should be ready to have a go with the issuance test
cases. Go to the <u>TestIssuance</u> class and run all test cases.
Running the library for the first time will make the system generate the
required parameters. Thus, there are a number of error messages, which
you can ignore. However, it is essential that the test cases verify! If
they do not verify correctly, you will have to fix your system setup
before you can continue! If the issuance process works correctly you
should find several <i>Credential_n.xml</i> files in the folder <i>tests/files/credentials</i>.</p>
<p>Having the credentials allows you to run the proof test cases -
theoretically. However, there are some details that you have to take
care of first.</p>
<ul>
	<li>If a new issuer key pair has been generated, those new bases
	have to go into several proof specifications. First, the proof
	specification <u>ProofSpecRep_Cred2Cred3.xml</u> specifies bases number
	6, 5 and 4 of the issuer public key to used. Thus, you have to replace
	the values in the proof specification with the corresponding bases
	stored in <u>ipk.xml</u>. Second, the complete credential also makes
	use of representations. More specifically, it specifies bases number 0
	and 1 to be used. That is why you have to replace the values in <u>ProofSpec_CredComplete</u>
	with the base number 0 and 1 from <u>ipk.xml</u>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now you can run the test cases of the proving protocol. Note that
after running all proof test cases you can run any test individually (if
it is a verification test, it will simply use the <u>*_proof.xml</u> and
<u>*_nonce.xml</u> files serialised during the previous run of the
proving protocol).</p>
<p>The last step is to run the tests from <u>TestUpdate</u>. Those
test will update values from several credentials. Note that some
credentials expire after a certain time. They MUST be updated to verify
correctly again. We do not guearantee to implement updates for all
credentials. Therefore you might have to re-issue selective credentials
if they expire.</p>

<h1>Understanding what is going on!</h1>
<h2>Architectural Ideas..</h2>
<p>The Identity Mixer anonymous credential system is documented in
various publications. We maintain the blog <a
	href="http://idemix.wordpress.com">idemix@wordpress</a> to keep collect
all necessary information.</p>
<p>When it comes to documentation of the current code, there is a
document describing the language that we use (<a
	href="http://www.zurich.ibm.com/~pbi/pub/BC2010-Mixing_Identities_with_Ease.pdf">Mixing
Identities with Ease</a>). In addition, we maintain a specification of the
implemented library, which is distributed together with the code. As by
now you have the test cases running, the best way of understanding the
code is probably by starting a simple test case in debugging mode and
follow the commands executed when running the code.</p>

<h1>Notes!</h1>
<h2>Logging..</h2>
<p>We use the standard Java (since Java 1.4) logging mechanism. We
mainly use the following levels:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Level.INFO: General information.</li>
	<li>Level.FINE: Detailed debuging information.</li>
	<li>Level.SEVERE: Error information.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Debugging Mode..</h2>
<p>When running the test cases or otherwise debugging the library,
there is a field <u>DEVELOPING</u> in the class <u>com.ibm.zrl.idmx.utils.Constants</u>.
Setting this field to true fixes the seed of the random generation
mechanism - thus you can run the tests several times using the same
randomness values.</p>
