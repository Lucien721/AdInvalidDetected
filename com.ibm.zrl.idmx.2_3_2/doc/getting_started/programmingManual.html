<h2>Glossary</h2>
<ul>
	<li><i>Attribute:</i> A typed and named data ﬁeld with a speciﬁc
	value for particular identities. Examples are names, dates, addresses,
	phone numbers, or citizenship.</li>
	<li><i>Credential:</i> A set of attribute values signed by some
	issuer.</li>
	<li><i>Issuer:</i> Entity which issues (i.e., generates)
	credentials. Each issuer publishes credential structures to
	characterise the credentials it issues.</li>
	<li><i>Credential structure:</i> Declaration of which attributes
	are contained in a credential and who knows them. This is relevant
	since attributes can be signed without the issuer learning their value
	(i.e., blind signature generation).</li>
	<li><i>Recipient:</i> Entity to receive and use a credential,
	i.e., representing a user of the anonymous credential system.</li>

<!-- 
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This document is not about cryptography; instead it aims at the
practicioner to explain how to use the features of the Identity Mixer
(aka. Idemix) library. The cryptographic theory can be found in [1, 2,
4]. The details of the inner workings of the library implementing the
Camenisch-Lysanskaya anonymous credential system is contained in [3].</p>
<p>In a nut-shell, the Idemix library can be used for two kinds of
operations:
<ul>
	<li><i>Credential generation:</i> the recipient initiates the <i>issuing
	protocol</i> with the issuer. It submits a set of attributes which are
	signed by the issuer. Attributes can be (1) <i>known</i> to both, the
	issuer and the recipient, (2) <i>committed</i> to (meaning that the
	recipient sends a commitment to the issuer), or (3) <i>hidden</i> from
	the issuer.</li>
	<li><i>Proof issuance and veriﬁcation:</i> Equipped with an Idemix
	credential, a prover can generate a proof that is then validated
	by the verifier. This may happens without revealing the values
	of the attributes or the identity of the prover to the veriﬁer. Using
	zero knowledge proofs of knowledge, the veriﬁer can still
	assert the validity of the submitted claims and respond with a yes or
	no answer.</li>
</ul>

<p>These are the most fundamental and frequent operations the
library is to be used for. In addtion, there are a few supporting
operations that have to be executed at first system usage.</p>

<ul>
	<li><i>Group parameters generation:</i> In order to
	generate issuer public and private keys, and thus to enable all
	subsequent operations, a set of public group parameters must be either
	generated or re-used. Note that this must be done only once, thereby
	establishing a system environment which can be re-used multiple times.</li>
	<li><i>User master secret gneration:</i> The user master secret
	key is used to generate new credentials and to bind proof issuance to
	previously created credentials. Thus the related operations take the
	user master secret as input argument. As the name implies, this data
	item must be kept secret and is bound to a speciﬁc certiﬁcate recipient
	and proof prover, i.e. a particular user. Once generated, a master
	secret key can be used in subsequent transactions.</li>
	<li><i>Issuer key generation:</i> When issuing a credential, the
	issuer uses the issuer private key. The recipient
	as well as prover and veriﬁer use the public component of
	the issuer key. Again such keys need only to be generated once and can
	be reused multiple times.</li>
</ul>

<!-- (pbi) I adapted the part above to v2.3.2 but it is unnecessary to publish 
as this information is now contained in the protocol specification. 
TODO (pbi) adapt the part below and extract the useful information (put it 
into the protocol specification such that there is only one document to be 
read!)
 
<p>In the sections below, we shall describe the relevant library
APIs and show how these operations can be performed. In various cases,
the input to the operations is based on data represented as XML
documents, embodying statements in the Identity Mixer Claims Language
(ICL) [5].</p>
<p>We assume that the reader is familiar with the Java Programming
Language and uses an integrated development environment (IDE) such as
the Eclipse work-bench in order to browse and use the library. The
library makes use of JavaDoc for internal documentation; we shall not
repeat all of this here.</p>

<h2>Public Group Parameters</h2>
<p>
The Camenisch-Lysanskaya signature scheme is based on the speciﬁc properties of algebraic
groups and certain operations in such groups. Before you can generate issuer keys, certiﬁcates,
generate and verify proofs, you need to have a set of such public group parameters.</p>
<p>These group parameters determine one particular algebraic, multiplicative3 , group (Z∗ ,
Γ, see [3] for details) of order Γ, which must then be the same for subsequent operations. In
other words, the group parameters determines the environment in which the operations of
the library are performed and must be communicated to all operating entities.
The group chosen here is used for information-theoretical hiding Pedersen commitments
and not for the Identity Mixer certiﬁcates. Identity Mixer works in a strong RSA group
where users are not privy of the group order (factorization of n). This group is used later for
the commitment scheme.</p>
<p>
These group parameters already must respect certain constraints which inﬂuence the
cryptographic strength of keys and certiﬁcates. These system parameters contain the lengths
of key material, the probability of prime number generation, etc. and are grouped into a
compound data item: the system parameters.</p>
<p>
Thus, this is the very ﬁrst operation to be performed: set up the system parameters and
thereby determining the cryptographic strength of subsequent operations. See also [3] for the
details of these system parameters.</p>
<p>
Programmatically, the Java class com.ibm.zrl.idemix.protocols.SystemParameters
groups the relevant values. It must be instantiated by passing the relevant arguments to its
constructor. These arguments can be embedded as constants in a Java program or be ob-
tained from Java’s system properties (e.g. java.lang.System.getProperty()) or a similar
conﬁguration environment. Fact is, that when generating public group parameters, ﬁrst a set
of appropriate system parameters must be established and used with most of the library’s
operations.</p>
<p>
Once the system parameters have been established, an instance of com.ibm.zrl.idemix.-
protocol. PublicParameters can be created - assuming it is the ﬁrst time the library is used
or a new set of public parameters is generated. Otherwise, an already created instance of
PublicParameters can be re-activated from persistent storage.</p>
<p>
The library provides a convenience method in class com.ibm.zrl.idemix.protocols.-
Utils.</p>
<p>
public static final PublicParameters loadOrGeneratePublicParameters(
File publicParamFile,
// the file to be written or read
SystemParameters sp,
// a set of system parameters
SecureRandom rand
// a secure random generator
) throws IOException;</p>
<p>
The method’s signature ﬁrst argument is publicParamFile. This is a reference to a ﬁle. If
the ﬁle does not exist, a new set of public group parameters is generated and saved to the
ﬁle. The Java representation of the data is returned.</p>
<p>
If the ﬁle already exists, it is read and the data is converted from the persisted format
into a Java object.</p>
<p>
The argument sp is only used when a new set of public group parameters is generated.
See [3] or the accompanying JavaDoc documentation for details on the arguments to class
SystemParameters’s constructor. When instantiating com.ibm.zrl.idemix.protocols.-
SystemParameters, we recommend using the below values:</p>
<p>
public final static SystemParameters sysParams = new SystemParameters(
2048, // l_n
1632, // l_capGamma
256, // l_rho
256, // l_m
256, // lPrime_m
597, // l_e
120, // lPrime_e
2724, // l_v
80,
// l_statzk
160, // l_k
256, // l_H
80,
// l_r
80
// l_primeProbg
);</p>
<p>
Weaker values impact the cryptographic strength of the solution and thus are not recom-
mended.</p>
<p>
A secure random generator is also needed to generate a new set of public group parameters.
This is passed as the last argument rand, which is ignored when creating a new set of public
parameters into a newly written ﬁle.</p>

<h2>Issuer Key Generation</h2>
<p>In order to create a certiﬁcate and also when using a previously created certiﬁcate, the issuer
key is needed. Recall from section 2 that certiﬁcate generation involves two parties: the
certiﬁcate recipient and the certiﬁcate issuer (the details on how to use these abstractions are
given in section 6). The certiﬁcate issuer must have knowledge of the public and the private
components of the issuer key. All other parties, i.e. the certiﬁcate recipient, a proof prover,
and a proof veriﬁer, will need only the public key of the issuer key.</p>
<p>
The components which make up the issuer key are described in [3]. Of importance is the
set R = {R1 , . . . , Rl }. This is a set of big-integer numbers; for details see the relevant section
in [3]. The cardinality l of that set is important: any certiﬁcate to be issued with a given key
can have at most l − lres user level attributes.</p>
<p>
For a programmer, class com.ibm.zrl.idemix.protocols.Utils provides the conve-
nience method to generate or read an issuer key from a ﬁle:</p>
<p>
public static final ProofCarryingKeyPair loadOrGenerateKeyPair(
File keyPairFile,
// the file to be written or read
PublicParameters pubParams, // a set of public group parameters
int nbrAttrs,
// max. nbr. of non-reserved attributes
SecureRandom rand
// secure random generator
) throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException;</p>
<p>
The parameters to the above method should be rather clear by now.</p>
<ul>
<li>keyPairFile: the ﬁle which is either created, if it does not exist, or is read. When a
new ﬁle is written, the binary representation of the issuer key pair is saved to the ﬁle.</li>
<li>pubParams: a set of public parameters. See section 3 how to get these. When reading
the issuer key from an already existing ﬁle, this parameter is ignored.</li>
<li>nbrAttrs: this corresponds to l − lres - the maximum number of certiﬁcate attributes
for certiﬁcates which can be signed with the issuer key. When reading from an already
existing ﬁle, this parameter is ignored.</li>
<li>rand: a secure random number generator. This parameter is also ignored when reading
the issuer key from an already existing ﬁle.</li>
</ul>

<p>
One important point to mention here is that the key generation binds the public group
parameters and thus the system parameters to the issuer key. Hence, whenever the key is to
be used in generation of certiﬁcates or issuance and veriﬁcation of proofs the public group
paramters in eﬀect at the time of use must be identical with the parameters used for key
generation.</p>
<p>
Depending on the strengths of the system parameters in eﬀect during key generation, the
key generation may take a noticeable amount of time. For RSA modulus size ln = 2048,
expect 10-20 minutes depending on the used hardware.</p>
<p>
Similar to other data types, the library provides methods to save an externalized repre-
sentation of ProofCarryingKeyPair.</p>
<p>
public String outputXml();
and
public void writeObject(
DataOutputStream out
) throws IOException;
// storing binary key data
</p>
<p>The class ProofCarryingKeyPair also provides a constructor to read-in a parameter set
from a data input stream.
</p>
<p>
public ProofCarryingKeyPair(
DataInputStream in // data input stream
) throws IOException;
</p>
<p>
When used, the constructor reads in the issuer proof key, containing public and private
components. The public component, in addition, contains the set of public group parameters
in effect during key generation.
</p>

<h2>User Master Secret</h2>
<p>Another data entity needed in various operations of the library is the user master secret. It
is needed when creating certiﬁcates and when tying proof assertions to certiﬁcates.</p>
<p>
Although one master secret per user would be suﬃcient, a user may well maintain a few
of these.</p>
<p>
Again, these entities are either generated or re-used from a previously persisted ﬁle. Thus
the already known class com.ibm.zrl.idemix.protocols.Utils provides an appropriate
convenience method to generate or read a user master secret from a ﬁle.</p>
<p>
public static final UserMasterSecret loadOrGenerateMasterSecret(
final String fileName,
// name of file to be written or being read
SecureRandom rand,
// a secure random number generator
PublicParameters pubParams // public group parameters
) throws IOException;
</p>
<p>The parameters to the above method are analoguous, respectively identical, to the ones
used in previous sections:</p>
<ul>
<li>fileName: a ﬁle name used in either reading or writing the user master secret.</li>
<li>rand: a secure random number generator instance. Ignored when reading an already
existing user master secret.</li>
<li>pubParams: a set of public parameters. See section 3 how to get these. When reading
the issuer key from an already existing ﬁle, this parameter is ignored.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Unlike the data items described in the previous sections, the user master secret, embod-
ied by com.ibm.zrl.idemix.protocols.UserMasterSecret can only be externalized to a
binary representation.</p>
<p>
public void writeObject(
DataOutputStream out
) throws IOException;
// storing the binary key data
To restore a user master secret without using com.ibm.zrl.idemix.protocols.Utils,
the UserMasterSecret class has an appropriate constructor:
public UserMasterSecret(
DataInputStream in
) throws IOException;
// input data stream to read from
</p>

<h2>Issuing Certiﬁcates</h2>
<p>
In the previous sections, we have shown how to obtain some ingredients to further operations
of the library. This section illustrates how a certiﬁcate is generated.</p>
<p>
Figure 1 illustrates the protocol executed between certiﬁcate recipient and certiﬁcate
issuer. We can distinguish following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Instantiation of a certiﬁcate recipient: The certiﬁcate recipient is the entity receiving
the generated certiﬁcate. It supplies the speciﬁcation of the recipient’s issuance asser-
tion, the user’s master secret, a set of public group parameters and a secure random
generator.</li>
<li>Instantiation of a certiﬁcate issuer: The certiﬁcate issuer is instantiated with the issuer’s
issuance assertion, the identical set of public group paramters and a secure random
generator.</li>
<li> Message exchanges between recipient and issuer: Five operations are performed between
recipient and issuer which exchange three messages. The ﬁrst, third, and last operation
is performed by the recipient; operational rounds two and four are run by the issuer.
The message format exchanged is abstracted away by the use of an appropriate Java
class com.ibm.zrl.idemix.credsystem.Message.</li>
<li>Extraction of certiﬁcate: The ultimate step is to extract the certiﬁcate on the recipient’s
side and store it away for later use; be it in binary or XML format.</li>
</ol>

<p>The above protocol can be run with the following Java code:
// open the assertions for issuer and recipient
FileInputStream issuerSpecIn =
new FileInputStream(new File(ISSUER_ASSERTION_FILE_NAME))
FileInputStream recipientSpecIn =
new FileInputStream(new File(RECIPIENT_ASSERTION_FILE_NAME));
// instantiate the certificate recipient
IssueCertificateRecipient recipient =
new IssueCertificateRecipient( recipientSpecIn, masterSecret,
pubParams, rand);
// instantiate the certificate issuer
IssueCertificateIssuer issuer =
new IssueCertificateIssuer(issuerSpecIn, pubParams, rand);
// run round0 of recipient...
Message msg0 = recipient.round0();
// run round0 of issuer...
Message msg1 = issuer.round0(msg0);
// run round1 of protocol
Message msg2 = recipient.round1(msg1);
// run round2 of protocol
Message msg3 = issuer.round2(msg2);
// run round3 of protocol
recipient.round3(msg3);
// extract certificate
HlNodeCertificate cert = recipient.getCertificate();
if (recipient.getErrorCode() != 0 || issuer.getErrorCode() != 0) {
// error handling
} else {
System.out.println( cert.outputXML()); // print certificate as XML
}
</p>
<p>The above Java code is rather straightforward. Some of the complexity is abstracted away in
the issuer and recipient assertions. These are passed as XML data converted into an input
stream. The library parses these XML documents and builds up internal data-structures
which are used in the issuance protocol. See [5] for details of the XML syntax for certiciate
recipient and certiﬁcate issuer assertions.</p>
<p>
The constants ISSUER ASSERTION FILE NAME and RECIPIENT ASSERTION FILE NAME in-
dicate some ﬁle names under which the XML assertions can be found. This are situation
speciﬁc and only illustrative.</p>
<p>
The cryptographic arguments to the constructors of classes com.ibm.zrl.idemix.cred-
system.IssueCertificateRecipient and com.ibm.zrl.idemix.credsystem.IssueCerti-
ficateIssuer have been described in sections 3 and 5.</p>
<p>
The above code sample refers to class com.ibm.zrl.idemix.credsystem.HlNodeCerti-
ficate. This data type holds the information describing the generated certiﬁcate. For details,
refer to the accompanying Java documentation.</p>
<p>
Note: certiﬁcates are generated with a globally unique id. This allows the recipient to refer
to newly generated certiﬁcates when persisting them. However, these certiﬁcate ids must
be obfuscated when certiﬁcates are to leave the recpient’s realm. That is, when inserting
certiﬁcates into XML documents, an alias local to the XML document under construction
must be used to avoid traceability of certiﬁcates outside the recipient’s realm. It is the
responsibility of the certiﬁcate recipient to perform such anonymizing aliasing of certiﬁcate
ids.</p>
<p>
The constructors of certiﬁcate recipient and certiﬁcate issuer have the following signatures:</p>
<p>
public IssueCertificateRecipient(
final InputStream assertionXML,
final UserMasterSecret masterSecret,
final PublicParameters publicParameters,
final SecureRandom random)
throws ParserConfigurationException, SAXException, IOException;
and
public IssueCertificateIssuer(
final InputStream assertionXML,
final PublicParameters publicParameters, final SecureRandom random)
throws ParserConfigurationException, SAXException, IOException;</p>
<p>
The arguments are rather self-explanatory, with the exception of the XML assertion input
streams. These express the values to be certiﬁed and which certiﬁcate speciﬁcations - in-
cluding the issuer’s signing key - information are to be used. The formats are described
in [5].</p>
<p>
The messages exchanged between the protocol entities are based on the Java class com.-
ibm.zrl.idemix.credsystem.Message. It is a ﬂexible envelope for the data required in the
protocol steps. For details, refer to [3] and the Java code of the library.
</p>

<h2>Proof Issuance and Verﬁciation</h2>
<p>Armed with an Idemix certiﬁcate, it is possible to generate proofs on speciﬁc statements and
have these veriﬁed without revealing sensitive information to the veriﬁer. The cryptographic
techniques used to achieve this functionality are described elsewhere ( [1, 2, 4]).</p>
<p>
The protocol run between proof prover and proof veriﬁer is shown in ﬁgure 2. It is
deceptively simple when omitting the cryptographic details.</p>
<ol>
<li>Instantiation of veriﬁer and prover: Both protocol entities are instantiated via calls to
the appropriate constructors. As arguments, the constructors require the user master
secret (prover only), the public group parameters, and a secure random number gener-
ator. The ﬁrst and crucial argument however is the prover’s respectively the veriﬁer’s
assertion: it expresses which claims are to be proven relative to which previously issued
Idemix certiﬁcates. (The details of the XML syntax for proof prover XML assertions
can be found in [5].)<br/>
Note that the values of the user master secret (prover only) as well as the public group
parameters must be the same as the values used in issuing the certiﬁcates embedded
in the proof prover’s assertion.</li>
<li>Veriﬁer’s nonce: a unique nonce - to guard against re-play attacks - is queried from the
proof veriﬁer instance and passed to the proof prover.</li>
<li>Proof issuance: The prover generates the proof statement which is extracted and passed
onto the proof veriﬁer.</li>
<li>Proof veriﬁcation: The veriﬁer uses the proof it as input arguments to its round1()
operation which as a side-effect computes success or failure of the proof veriﬁcation.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
In Java terms, the following code retraces the protocol of ﬁgure 2.
</p>
<p>
FileInputStream verifierSpecIn =
new FileInputStream( new File( VERIFIER_SPEC_FILE_NAME));
FileInputStream proverSpecIn =
new FileInputStream( new File( PROVER_SPEC_FILE_NAME));
// obtain a unique verifier nonce to avoid replays
APInteger nonce = ProveVerifier.getVerifierNonce(pubParams, rand);
ProveProver prover =
new ProveProver(proverSpecIn, masterSecret, pubParams, rand);
ProveVerifier verifier =
new ProveVerifier(verifierSpecIn, pubParams, rand, nonce);
try {
// verifier.getNonce() == nonce
prover.computeProof( verifier.getNonce());
} catch ( Exception e) {
// error handling
}
CryptographicProof cryptoProof = prover.getProof();
if ( cryptoProof.getMessage().getErrorCode() == 0) { // proof ok
byte[] cryptoProofByteArr = cryptoProof.toBinary();
// simulate going over the wire
CryptographicProof cryptoProofNew =
new CryptographicProof( cryptoProofByteArr);
verifier.round1( cryptoProofNew);
}
if ( verifier.isSuccess()) {
// success
} else {
// failure
}</p>
<p>
Similar to the case of certiﬁcate issuance (section 6), the bulk of the arguments to the
operations are passed as XML data containing the proof assertions, for both - the prover and
the veriﬁer. See [5] for the details of the XML syntax and semantics.</p>
<p>
Note the conversion of the cryptographic proof into an array of bytes cryptoProof.-
toBinary() and its injection into the verﬁer’s round1().</p>
<p>
When completed, the success or failure is extracted with the verifier.isSuccess()
method call.</p>
<p>
The various method signatures are described in the Java documentation accompanying
the library. We here only indicate the constructor signatures, as these are slightly more
complex.</p>
<p>
public ProveProver(
final InputStream assertionXML,
final UserMasterSecret masterSecret,
final PublicParameters publicParameters,
final SecureRandom random
) throws ParserConfigurationException, SAXException, IOException;
and
public ProveVerifier(
final InputStream assertionXML,
final PublicParameters publicParameters,
final SecureRandom random,
final APInteger nonce)
throws ParserConfigurationException, SAXException, IOException;</p>
<p>
Amongst the arguments to the ProveProver() constructor, notice the masterSecret. This
must be identical with the value used to generate the certiﬁcate contained in the proof
prover’s assertion - passed as an XML containing input stream. The same applies for the
publicParameters arguments used in the constructors for both, the ProveProver and the
ProveVerifier: their value must also be identical with the value used during certiﬁcate
issuance.</p>
<p>
The nonce argument for the ProveVerifier constructor is used to detect replays and
must be obtained before using the constructor. The corresponding (static) method is Prover-
Verifier.getVerifierNonce( PublicParameters, SecureRandom) which returns an ap-
propriate random nonce.</p>
<p>
The library also provides a constructor for class ProveVerifier which implicitly generates
the veriﬁer’s nonce. Its signature is</p>
<p>
public ProveVerifier(
final InputStream assertionXML,
final PublicParameters publicParameters,
final SecureRandom random)
throws ParserConfigurationException, SAXException, IOException;</p>
<p>
Depending on the embedding of the proof generation and veriﬁcation, either constructor for
the veriﬁer can be used - obtaining the veriﬁer nonce a-priori allows to delay generation of
the veriﬁer assertion until after proof generation which is needed when the prover and the
veriﬁer are not co-resident in a same address space. It then becomes possible to pass the
nonce and the proof in a single message from prover to veriﬁer.</p>
<p>
For both, the proof prover and the proof veriﬁer, the XML formatted assertions, passed
into the respective constructors, contain the claim statements to be proven, respectively
veriﬁed. See [5] for syntax and semantics.</p>
<p>
The other operations used during proof issuance and veriﬁcation are documented with
the Java documentation accompanying the library.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>In the previous sections we have described the speciﬁc steps needed to manipulate Idemix
related data and operations. Figure 3 attemps to recap the overall data ﬂow for the scenarios
of certiﬁcate generation and proof issuance and veriﬁcation. Note that issuer key generation
is not explicitly shown.</p>
<p>
The key data elements and their dependencies are illustrated in ﬁgure 3. We have used
dashed lines to indicate data inclusion; solid arrows denote data use as method arguments.
Data exchanges (protocols) between active entities are shown as double-headed, dashed ar-
rows.</p>
<p>
The public group parameters are used pervasively throughout the environment. The
user master secret is used during certiﬁcate issuance and proof generation, by the certiﬁcate
recipient and the proof prover respectively.</p>
<p>
The issuer signing key is used indirectly by inclusion in the XML assertions for certiﬁcate
reception, certiﬁcate issuance, proof generation and proof veriﬁcation. Note that the private
issuer key is only included in the certiﬁcate issuer’s assertion; see [5] for details.
Certiﬁcate speciﬁcations are needed for certiﬁcate issuance and proof generation - veriﬁ-
cation. Their XML representation is included in the respective assertions, as well as in the
assertions for proof generation and veriﬁcation.</p>
<p>
Certiﬁcate data is embedded in proof generation and proof veriﬁcation assertions.
The claims included in the various assertions are not represented in above diagram. These
express the predicates on attributes and constant values. It is up to any application, using ap-
propriate Java packages, to generate correctly formatted assertion grouping claims, certiﬁcate
speciﬁcations, and - if necessary - certiﬁates. The library accepts the XML representations
of assertion as input stream arguments.</p>
<p>
Not shown in ﬁgure 3 are uses of the secure random generators.</p>
